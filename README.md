# ProxyGuy

**ProxyGuy** is a free, cross-platform HTTP(S) debugging proxy built with .NET MAUI and Titanium.Web.Proxy. It delivers a professional traffic-inspection experience comparable to Proxyman, while remaining completely zero-cost and open for customization.

## Features
- Capture and inspect HTTP and HTTPS requests routed through `127.0.0.1:9090` with per-request logging.
- Domain-aware sidebar that groups traffic by host and keeps a running history of recent backends.
- Instant filtering by domain, HTTP method, status code, or free-text search to isolate the traffic that matters.
- Rich request/response inspector with headers, bodies, and automatic JSON pretty printing for structured payloads.
- Live session controls to start or pause listening, clear the timeline, collapse the sidebar, and focus on key details.
- One-click export of any captured exchange to a timestamped text file for offline analysis or sharing.

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:** .NET MAUI single-project UI targeting Windows, macOS (Mac Catalyst), iOS, and Android.
- **Proxy engine:** [Titanium.Web.Proxy](https://github.com/justcoding121/Titanium-Web-Proxy) handles low-level proxying, SSL decryption, and stream interception.
- **State management:** CommunityToolkit MVVM bindings keep the UI reactive across request lists, filters, and detail panels.
- **Storage:** Exported sessions and app data are written to the per-platform application data folder.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tooling is installed before building the project:
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (`dotnet --list-sdks` should show 8.x).
- .NET MAUI workloads for your target platforms:
  - `dotnet workload install maui` (installs all supported workloads).
  - Optional: install `maui-ios`, `maui-android`, or `maui-maccatalyst` individually if you only need specific targets.
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 17.8+ with the ".NET Multi-platform App UI development" workload, Windows 10 version 19041 or later.
  - **macOS/iOS:** Xcode 15+, the .NET 8 SDK for macOS Arm64/Intel, and the MAUI workloads listed above.
  - **Android:** Android SDK 34+, device or emulator, and the Android MAUI workload.

## Build & Run
Clone the repository and restore dependencies:
```bash
cd ProxyGuy
dotnet restore ProxyGuy.sln
```

Build or run for the platform you need:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Windows (WinUI) | `dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -c Debug -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0`<br>`dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -t:Run -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0` |
| macOS (Mac Catalyst) | `dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -c Debug -f net8.0-maccatalyst`<br>`dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -t:Run -f net8.0-maccatalyst` |
| Android | `dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -c Debug -f net8.0-android`<br>`dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -t:Run -f net8.0-android` |
| iOS (simulator) | `dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -c Debug -f net8.0-ios`<br>`dotnet build ProxyGuy.sln -t:Run -f net8.0-ios /p:_DeviceName=:v2:udid=<simulator-udid>` |

> Tip: Use `-c Release` for production-ready binaries once you are satisfied with your local testing.

## Usage
1. Launch ProxyGuy on your desktop or device. The proxy listens on `127.0.0.1:9090` by default.
2. Toggle **Listening** if you need to pause or resume the capture session.
3. Point the device or application under test to the ProxyGuy proxy:
   - **Desktop:** Configure system proxy settings to use `http://127.0.0.1:9090` for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
   - **Mobile:** Connect the device to the same network as ProxyGuy and set the Wi-Fi proxy to the machine running the app.
   - **Command line:** Add `--proxy http://127.0.0.1:9090` (curl) or the equivalent flag for your tooling.
4. Generate traffic. Requests and responses will appear grouped by domain in the sidebar and detailed in the main panel.
5. Select any entry to inspect headers, payloads, durations, and status codes. Toggle between raw and prettified JSON views as needed.
6. Use the export action to save a full transcript of the selected exchange to a local text file.

## Example Workflow
```bash
# Start proxy from your desktop, then from another terminal:
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:9090 https://api.example.com/health
```
The request immediately surfaces in ProxyGuy, letting you validate headers, cookies, and payloads before sharing the captured trace with teammates.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- HTTPS interception requires trusting the root certificate generated by Titanium.Web.Proxy. Consult the Titanium documentation for platform-specific trust instructions if browsers warn about untrusted certificates.
- Close other proxy tools (including Proxyman) that may already occupy port 9090 before launching ProxyGuy, or adjust the listening port in the source.
- If a platform build fails after installing workloads, run `dotnet workload repair` to ensure tooling is synchronized with your SDK version.
